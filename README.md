# Wikidata Atlas ðŸ—º
[Wikidata Atlas](https://wdatlas.dcc.uchile.cl/) is a platform that allows Wikidata entities that have geographic coordinate properties to be displayed on a world map, such as museums, stadiums, destroyed buildings or structures, nuclear weapons tests, among many others.

## Dump preprocessing
Before approaching the project, a pre-processing of the Wikidata database was carried out, focused on the geolocation of entities and the analysis of the types of georeferenced entities.

## System Architecture
The project architecture is the classic client-server model. For the backend, an API was developed using the Python Flask framework, on the other hand, the frontend was developed using the React.js Javascript framework.


### Flask API
The API that was created is fed from a JSON file generated after preprocessing and parsing the Wikidata dump. This will be vital for the implementation of the autocompletion of the system. Also, to obtain information on the instances of georeferenced types, the [Wikidata Query Service](https://query.wikidata.org/) endpoint was used to execute a SPARQL query that obtains all the instances of a given type with information such as his label, the description, coordinate location, referencial image and country.

### Web Interface
As previously mentioned, the React.js framework was used to develop the system interface. In addition, Bootstrap was used to improve the visual aspect of the different components of the system interface.
For the generation of the world map, the Leaflet library was used, specifically the npm package [react-leaflet](https://react-leaflet.js.org/) for the use of React components.
